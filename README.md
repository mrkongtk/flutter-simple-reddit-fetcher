# Flutter Reddit Technology Fetcher

Welcome to the Flutter Reddit Technology Fetcher project! This small yet engaging project is designed to fetch the latest content from the `r/technology` subreddit on Reddit. It not only lists the fetched data but also provides links to the content threads. The primary objectives of this repository are to explore and demonstrate how to utilize Flutter for managing network connections, implementing progressive data listing, navigating between pages, creating test cases, and adhering to the MVVM architectural pattern.
